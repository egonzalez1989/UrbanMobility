# A multiagent design of urban incidents involving pedestrians and vehicles based on Weighted A*

This project implements a multi-agent system for simulating interactions between pedestrians and drivers in urban environments with obstacles, congestion, and heterogeneous behaviors. The framework is designed to study conflict zones, mobility efficiency, and safety-related events using AgentPy.

## Key Features
- Multiagent urban simulation integrating pedestrians and vehicles within a city grid.
- Weighted A* is used for path planning as well as a behavioral model.
- Local sensing and reaction mechanisms enable realistic reactions and interactions.
- Heatmap-based analysis identifies conflict-prone urban zones for safety

## Quick start
### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- AgentPy
- NumPy, Matplotlib

### Run basic simulations
Basic executions and examples can be found in Jupyter Notebook *UrbanSimulation.ipynb*
